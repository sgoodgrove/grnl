# grnl

## Overview

A one-command, super-simple diary or journal to keep track of things.

## Justificiation

I needed this simple tool because I had an itch to scratch. I've tried a couple of different methods for keeping a diary and quite simply I never keep to it. Often the reason is that I'm in a hurry and need to write something down without worrying about loading something up, without worrying about formatting and more. I just literally want to put something down as quickly as a post-it note and be able to find it again later.

The intention for this script is that you can simply go to the command line, type `grnl` followed by your entry text and then append that to a single text file, tagged with the date. This file can then be referred back to. I have other tools for more formal documentation and time recording and my workflow is to record notes with grnl and transfer the detail to these other tools when I make time for it.

## Why not Org-Mode or X

I like org-mode, I really do, but as my documentation, calendar and other information go into other tools I can't really justify the weight of learning and using org-mode, only to transfer those details to another application at a later date. In a nutshell though, I still want something that is lightweight that can be used quickly, from anywhere and without really thinking about it.
